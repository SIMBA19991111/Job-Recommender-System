# Job-Recommender-System
Our project aims to develop a Job recommender system basing on the dataset containing the log  data for a fictional “Jobs” website
Dataset:
Our dataset has 4 columns:
- Date 
- UserID 
- JobID 
- Event

There are 20714 rows in total.

Overall features include:
- Date
- Number of users and jobs
- Type of events

There are 591 out of 600 items and 1776 out of 1800 users involved.

We have used three algorithms to support our recommendation system:

- User-based collaborative filtering recommendation
- Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation
- SVD model for optimization.
